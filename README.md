A back-end database for tracking seedlings and plants

My second attempt at creating a database app aimed at allowing tracking of vegetable and fruit plants from seed to full grown plant. A MySQL database will allow storage of data on seed types, batches of planted seeds and then individual plants that are selected. The aim to to use printed QR codes to track batches of seedlings and plants to allow access to retrieve and edit data via mobile devices while giving a full interface via computer browser.
